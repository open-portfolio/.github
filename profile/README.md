# Welcome to the _Open Portfolio Project_!

The _Open Portfolio Project_ is part of the [_OpenAlloc_](https://github.com/openalloc/) family of investing applications for macOS.

## Portfolio App Project

Apps for rebalancing a portfolio and tracking its value over time, for macOS.

These are available on the App Store as **free** downloads for macOS.

### Flow Allocator

A portfolio rebalancing tool.

* [FlowAllocator](https://openalloc.github.io/FlowAllocator/) - product website
* [FlowAllocator Project](https://github.com/open-portfolio/FlowAllocatorApp/) - Github site for the development project, including full source code

### Flow Worth

A tool for tracking the value and performance of a portfolio over time.

* [FlowWorth](https://openalloc.github.io/FlowWorth/) - product website
* [FlowWorth Project](https://github.com/open-portfolio/FlowWorthApp/) - Github site for the development project, including full source code

They are formerly proprietary applications now fully open-sourced as of August 2022. 

## Libraries

Swift libraries written principally to support the apps above, available as Swift Packages.

### Financial data import

* [AllocData](https://github.com/open-portfolio/AllocData) - standardized data formats for investing-focused apps and tools
* [FINporter](https://github.com/open-portfolio/FINporter) - library and command-line tool to transform various specialized finance-related formats to the standardized schema of AllocData

* TODO list other libraries here

## Your Participation is Essential

As an open source project, we depend on our community of users (and eventually developers) for support.

**The most important thing you can do now is to rate and review the apps in the App Store. Preferably favorably! :)**

(This will help to broaden the base of users, to find bugs and improve the apps.)

Future portfolio apps to add to the family are certainly possible, should good ideas emerge.

To report a bug or suggest a feature, add an Issue to the relevant Github project.

## XCode Setup

See the [Workspace](https://github.com/open-portfolio/Workspace) repository for a handy Xcode workspace that contains most of the repositories.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. You are encouraged to submit pull requests to fix bugs, improve documentation, or offer new features. 

The pull request need not be a production-ready feature or fix. It can be a draft of proposed changes, or simply a test to show that expected behavior is buggy. Discussion on the pull request can proceed from there.

Contributions should ultimately have adequate test coverage. See tests for current entities to see what coverage is expected.

Your contributions can be under the your name or organization, but must have a compatible license, preferably MPL-2.0 (for app code) or Apache-2.0 (for re-usable library code).

(This should probably be expanded to a proper policy.)
